### Booting from an external drive (USB or SD Card)

In order to launch SteamFork from an external drive you will need to first change the boot order in the BIOS.  

During boot you can enter the bios by either (1) holding the ++"Home"+"LCC (Turbo)"++ buttons that sit bellow the dpad and right analog stick OR (2) connecting an external keyboard and pressing the ++del++ key.  

In the bios; navigate to the `Boot` menu and then change the boot order to prioritize the SD card or USB Drive under `Boot Order Priorities`. Then go `Save & Exit` and select the Save Changes and Exit option.  This change will persist through all reboots.  If you want to boot into Windows simply remove the SD Card or USB drive.
